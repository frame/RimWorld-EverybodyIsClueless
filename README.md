# Everybody Is Clueless

Removes starting research from all factions.

This affects the "New Tribe" and "New Arrivals" factions from the base game as well as all custom factions. To ensure that factions added by mods don't start with research, it is recommended that you move this mod to the very end of your mod list.

Scenarios are not affected. This means that you can still add a "start with research" part in the scenario editor, and that you will need to modify existing scenarios to remove any research. For example "The Rich Explorer" starts with "Gun turrets" which would automatically unlock much of the electricity tech tree.

This mod is safe to remove from saves because it only changes the start of the game.

There are a number of other mods that serve a similar purpose: some introduce a custom faction to choose from in the scenario editor, others just change the vanilla factions. In contrast, this mod is tailored for those who never want to start with research. It is also quite minimal, consisting of just a single patch operation, ensuring that it remains lightweight and easily compatible with future versions of Rimworld.
